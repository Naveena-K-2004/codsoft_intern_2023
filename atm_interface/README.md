# Atm Interface
Let's build an ATM adventure!

1. We've got an ATM class in the house.

2. UI time! Choose: Withdraw, Deposit, or Check Balance.

3. Methods alert! withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), checkBalance() are our heroes.

4. Meet the Bank Account class. It's your balance buddy.

5. ATM + Bank Account = Power Duo. Balance is in our hands!

6. No funny business! User input stays within limits.

7. Messages, messages! Success or oops moments get their spotlight. Ready for a seamless transaction journey? Let's roll!
